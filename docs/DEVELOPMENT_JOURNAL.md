# Development Journal — Helix AI Jumpstart SCO Prototype (GB10)

> **Purpose:** A single chronological record of *every* meaningful development on this
> project — decisions, docs, code, container/infra work, test results, and known issues.
> This is the fast way for any human or AI agent to understand "what happened and why"
> without re-reading every file.

## How to use / maintain this journal (MANDATORY)
- **Newest entry goes at the TOP** of the "Entries" section, under a dated `##` heading.
- **Update it in the SAME change** that does the work — never leave the journal stale.
- Each entry must record: **what changed**, **why**, **verified results (real, not assumed)**,
  **git ref if committed (else "uncommitted")**, and **open issues / follow-ups**.
- **Be honest.** Record fallbacks, failures, and overclaims. Do not write that something
  works unless it was actually verified on-device.
- This rule is mirrored in [`.devin/rules/helix-sco.md`](../.devin/rules/helix-sco.md).

## Project snapshot (current state)
- **Branch:** `feat/iteration2-scaffolding-and-poa`
- **Phase:** Phase 1 (seeded synthetic Manufacturing data generator) — **complete, uncommitted**.
- **Vertical:** Manufacturing (confirmed by Ryan, 2026-06-30).
- **Stack (verified on GB10):** `api` (FastAPI + nomic-embed embeddings + cuOpt/OR-Tools),
  `llm` (vLLM serving Nemotron 30B FP8 MoE), `vectordb` (Qdrant). cuOpt fell back to OR-Tools (CPU).
- **Next:** Phase 2 (secure API layer + baseline + ingest/forecast).

## 2026-07-01 — Phase 1 brutal-truth review + fixes
**Status:** Independently re-verified on the live GB10 stack; **uncommitted**.

**Why:** Reviewed the Phase 1 deliverable against actual on-device behaviour rather than the
build report, to catch overclaims and defects before Phase 2 builds on these schemas.

**Independently re-verified (real runs, api container up):**
- Byte-identical determinism: two `generate.py --seed 42 --scenario baseline` runs produced no
  `sha256sum` diff. Re-verified again after the code fix below — still byte-identical.
- `pytest tests/test_data_generator.py`: **11/11** passed.
- `pytest tests/` (full suite): **28/28** passed (Phase 0 smoke tests intact).
- All **four** scenarios generate end-to-end (build report had only run 2):
  `baseline`/`component-shortage-shock`/`demand-surge` = 2,912 demand rows + 1,560 lane-period rows;
  `stress-large` = 44,928 demand rows + 15,808 lane-period rows (confirms it stretches the network).
- Generated files under `data/generated/` confirmed gitignored (`git check-ignore` positive;
  0 generated files in `git status`).

**Defects found and fixed:**
- **Mixed numeric formatting in `demand.csv.base_quantity_units`.** The column is documented as
  `float`, but derived-component rows emitted bare ints (e.g. `371`) while finished-goods rows
  emitted float form (`371.000000`). Fixed by casting derived `base_quantity_units` to `float` in
  `build_component_demand` (both subassembly and raw-component rows). Output now uniform `.6f`.
- **Test gap that let the above slip through.** The schema test parsed float columns with
  `float(...)`, which silently accepts integer strings. Added a regression guard asserting every
  float-typed column is rendered in float form (contains `.`). Guard passes across all 4 scenarios.

**Reviewed and accepted as-is (not defects):**
- `random_seed_override` in a scenario would override the CLI `--seed`; all four configs leave it
  null, and `metadata.json` records both `requested_seed` and effective `seed`, so this is a
  documented, intentional feature — flagged here only so Phase 2 is aware.
- Plant capacity is sized against finished-goods throughput (assembly), not derived component load;
  intentional. Baseline capacity-sanity test passes.

**Open issues / follow-ups:**
- Consider a small safety check so `--output-dir` cannot point at a parent dir before `rmtree`.
- Phase 2 should consume these documented schemas through the secure API/ingest layer.

## 2026-07-01 — Phase 1 complete: seeded synthetic Manufacturing data generator
**Status:** Built and verified on the live GB10 stack; **uncommitted**.

**What changed:**
- Added `data/generator/generate.py` plus `data/generator/README.md`.
  - Generates a synthetic Manufacturing topology: suppliers -> plants/production lines -> DCs -> customers.
  - Generates multi-tier BOMs with finished goods -> subassemblies -> raw components.
  - Generates lumpy finished-goods demand with seasonality, trend, noise, and optional shock multipliers.
  - Derives component demand from the BOM so component demand is correlated with finished-goods demand.
  - Generates plant/line capacities, inbound and finished-goods lanes, lane costs, lead-time distributions,
    period-level lane disruption effects, SKU cost parameters, service targets, and initial inventory.
  - Writes deterministic CSV + JSON outputs with `scenario` and `seed` recorded in every CSV and full
    reproducibility metadata in `metadata.json`.
- Added four scenario configs in `data/scenarios/`:
  `baseline`, `component-shortage-shock`, `demand-surge`, and `stress-large`.
- Added `make data` and `make test-data`.
  - `make data` runs inside the running `api` container and writes host-visible outputs under
    `data/generated/<scenario>/`.
  - `make test-data` runs only Phase 1 generator tests inside `api`.
- Added CPU-only generator deps to `requirements-api.txt`: `numpy`, `PyYAML`.
- Updated container wiring so the API image contains `data/` and the running container bind-mounts
  `./data:/app/data`; `.dockerignore` now excludes only generated data, not generator/config sources.
- Added `tests/test_data_generator.py` covering determinism, schemas/dtypes, no required nulls,
  BOM-linked component-demand correlation, baseline capacity sanity, supply shock periods,
  demand surge periods, seed/scenario metadata, and generated-output PII/real-company-name checks.

**Verified results (real runs):**
- Rebuilt API image successfully: `docker compose build api`.
- Recreated API container successfully: `docker compose up -d --no-deps api`; API returned healthy.
- `make data SEED=42 SCENARIO=baseline` succeeded and produced:
  `nodes.csv`, `skus.csv`, `bom.csv`, `demand.csv`, `production_lines.csv`, `lanes.csv`,
  `lane_periods.csv`, `service_targets.csv`, `initial_inventory.csv`, `metadata.json`.
  Baseline row counts checked: 17 nodes, 28 SKUs, 24 BOM rows, 2,912 demand rows, 30 lanes,
  1,560 lane-period rows.
- `make data SEED=42 SCENARIO=component-shortage-shock` succeeded with the same file set.
  Shock row counts checked: 17 nodes, 28 SKUs, 24 BOM rows, 2,912 demand rows, 30 lanes,
  1,560 lane-period rows.
- Determinism verified after final generator change:
  `sha256sum data/generated/baseline/* | sort` before and after a second
  `make data SEED=42 SCENARIO=baseline` produced no `diff`.
- `make test-data` passed: **11/11** tests.
- `make test` passed: **28/28** tests, including existing Phase 0 health, embeddings, LLM,
  Qdrant, and cuOpt/OR-Tools fallback tests.

**Deviations / corrections:**
- During verification, the generated metadata initially used a Helix-branded generator string.
  The new no-real-names test caught it; the output metadata was changed to neutral
  `manufacturing-synthetic-data`, and the tests were rerun successfully.
- No GPU-specific package was added for data generation; Phase 1 generation remains CPU-only.

**Open issues / follow-ups:**
- Phase 2 should consume these documented schemas through the secure API/ingest layer rather than
  duplicating parsing logic.
- Generated files under `data/generated/` remain gitignored and reproducible from seed/config.

## 2026-06-30 — Phase 0 executed (environment & container baseline) + review
**Status:** Built in a separate working session; **reviewed and corrected here; uncommitted.**

**What was built (all arm64, GB10):**
- **`Dockerfile` (`api`):** `nvcr.io/nvidia/cuda:13.0.1-devel-ubuntu24.04` base; Python 3.12,
  FastAPI/Uvicorn, sentence-transformers, torch; `/health` endpoint reporting GPU/CUDA via
  `nvidia-smi` + `nvcc`.
- **`docker/llm/Dockerfile` (`llm`):** `vllm/vllm-openai` serving
  `nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-FP8` (MoE) with FP8 weights + FP8 KV cache;
  weights cached to a volume.
- **`docker-compose.yml`:** 3-service GPU-reserved stack (`api`, `llm`, `vectordb`);
  cuOpt logic integrated inside `api` (not a separate service).
- **`src/api/`:** `health.py`, `embeddings.py` (nomic-embed-text-v1.5, 768-dim, lazy GPU load),
  `cuopt_smoke.py` (tries cuOpt → falls back to OR-Tools VRP).
- **`Makefile`:** `up`/`down`/`build`/`ps`/`logs`/`test` (+ `gpu-check`, `*-check`) via `docker compose` v2.
- **`tests/`:** 17 pytest smoke/health tests (service health, embeddings, LLM, Qdrant, cuOpt).

**Verified results (reported from on-device run):**
- `docker compose up` → 3 containers healthy on `helix-gb10-intern`.
- **api:** GPU visible inside container, CUDA 13, nvcc present.
- **llm:** Nemotron served via vLLM; completion test passes; **~31.48 GiB** GPU allocated.
- **embeddings:** nomic-embed loaded on GPU, 768-dim verified; **~813 MiB** allocated.
- **vectordb:** Qdrant create/insert/query round-trip passes.
- **cuOpt:** **no arm64 `cuopt-cu13` wheel** → **fell back to OR-Tools (CPU)**; VRP solved,
  route `[0, 1, 3, 2, 0]`, distance `80`. (Proceed-without-blocking honored.)
- **Tests:** reported **17/17 passing** on the GB10.

**Review corrections made this session:**
- Fixed `docker-compose.yml` header comment (claimed "Four-service … cuopt-fallback"; actually
  3 services with cuOpt integrated in `api`).
- Created this journal; added a journal-maintenance rule to `.devin/rules/helix-sco.md` and a
  pointer in the Plan of Action's mandatory-reading list.

**Known issues / follow-ups (carry into later phases):**
- **Overclaim corrected:** the prior session's summary said it created `walkthrough.md`; that
  file does **not** exist in the repo. This journal is the system of record instead.
- **Unpinned `:latest`** on `vllm/vllm-openai` and `qdrant/qdrant` → not reproducible. Pin to
  verified tags/digests.
- **torch via `--extra-index-url .../cu131`** is unusual; it resolved to a CUDA aarch64 build
  that works, but pin a known-good wheel.
- **No API auth yet.** The "API-first *secure*" directive (authN/authZ, validation, secrets)
  is **not** met — deferred to the Phase 2 API layer. Acceptable for a Phase 0 baseline.
- **I did not re-run** the GPU/LLM suite in this review session (heavy: model downloads + long
  vLLM warmup); I verified the sources compile and audited logic. Re-run `make up && make test`
  to re-confirm before relying on the numbers above.

## 2026-06-30 — Iteration 2 docs updated for Ryan's decisions
**Git:** committed `fc22dae` (pushed).
- Folded Ryan's 2026-06-30 feedback into `docs/Iteration2_Plan_of_Action.md` and
  `docs/Iteration2_Point3_Scaffolding_Response_to_Ryan.md`:
  Manufacturing vertical; **Nemotron ~30B FP8 MoE** (single shared LLM); **nomic-embed-text-v1.5**;
  **Qdrant** (LanceDB fallback); **GPU-accelerated ingestion**; **API-first secure APIs**
  (web + CLI + future MCP share them); **Docker Compose v2**; **Dev/PoC** product shape;
  **proceed-without-blocking**; NVAIE not needed for dev (NFR available).
- Converted the Response doc's "open questions" into a confirmed-decisions table.

## 2026-06-29 / 30 — Iteration 2 scaffolding docs authored
**Git:** committed `efbf7e2` (pushed); branch `feat/iteration2-scaffolding-and-poa` created.
- `docs/Iteration2_Point3_Scaffolding_Response_to_Ryan.md` — tools/models scaffolding answer
  (models + why + fit), web-UI vs CLI, before/after scenario stats.
- `docs/Iteration2_Plan_of_Action.md` — phased build blueprint (Phase 0–6) for a fresh agent.
- Later edited to remove verbatim quoting of Ryan's messages and a self-contradicting
  hard-coded UI percentage; corrected an OR-Tools/HiGHS routing inaccuracy.

## (earlier) — Iteration 1 + environment baseline
- `docs/AI_Jumpstart_MVP_Iteration1_v1_paper-grounded.md` and `_v2_standalone.md` — use-case map,
  data elements, pipeline shape, honest reconciliation of the PPO/(s,S) evidence.
- `docs/environment.md` — live GB10 probe (arm64, CUDA 13.0, driver 580.159.03, 121 GiB unified,
  ~273 GB/s bandwidth).
- `docs/containerization.md` — GPU-in-container verified; pinned arm64 CUDA 13 base; NGC dev key
  configured; `ishan` added to `docker` group.
- `.devin/rules/helix-sco.md` — non-negotiable guardrails (bandwidth-bound; PPO must earn its
  place; ~94% figure framing; no hospital service-level claim; data on-device; flag prompt-injection).
