# Development Journal — Helix AI Jumpstart SCO Prototype (GB10)

> **Purpose:** A single chronological record of *every* meaningful development on this
> project — decisions, docs, code, container/infra work, test results, and known issues.
> This is the fast way for any human or AI agent to understand "what happened and why"
> without re-reading every file.

## How to use / maintain this journal (MANDATORY)
- **Newest entry goes at the TOP** of the "Entries" section, under a dated `##` heading.
- **Update it in the SAME change** that does the work — never leave the journal stale.
- Each entry must record: **what changed**, **why**, **verified results (real, not assumed)**,
  **git ref if committed (else "uncommitted")**, and **open issues / follow-ups**.
- **Be honest.** Record fallbacks, failures, and overclaims. Do not write that something
  works unless it was actually verified on-device.
- This rule is mirrored in [`.devin/rules/helix-sco.md`](../.devin/rules/helix-sco.md).

## Project snapshot (current state)
- **Branch:** `feat/iteration2-scaffolding-and-poa`
- **Phase:** Phase 0 (environment & container baseline) — **complete, uncommitted**.
- **Vertical:** Manufacturing (confirmed by Ryan, 2026-06-30).
- **Stack (verified on GB10):** `api` (FastAPI + nomic-embed embeddings + cuOpt/OR-Tools),
  `llm` (vLLM serving Nemotron 30B FP8 MoE), `vectordb` (Qdrant). cuOpt fell back to OR-Tools (CPU).
- **Next:** Phase 1 (seeded synthetic Manufacturing data generator).

## 2026-06-30 — Phase 0 executed (environment & container baseline) + review
**Status:** Built in a separate working session; **reviewed and corrected here; uncommitted.**

**What was built (all arm64, GB10):**
- **`Dockerfile` (`api`):** `nvcr.io/nvidia/cuda:13.0.1-devel-ubuntu24.04` base; Python 3.12,
  FastAPI/Uvicorn, sentence-transformers, torch; `/health` endpoint reporting GPU/CUDA via
  `nvidia-smi` + `nvcc`.
- **`docker/llm/Dockerfile` (`llm`):** `vllm/vllm-openai` serving
  `nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-FP8` (MoE) with FP8 weights + FP8 KV cache;
  weights cached to a volume.
- **`docker-compose.yml`:** 3-service GPU-reserved stack (`api`, `llm`, `vectordb`);
  cuOpt logic integrated inside `api` (not a separate service).
- **`src/api/`:** `health.py`, `embeddings.py` (nomic-embed-text-v1.5, 768-dim, lazy GPU load),
  `cuopt_smoke.py` (tries cuOpt → falls back to OR-Tools VRP).
- **`Makefile`:** `up`/`down`/`build`/`ps`/`logs`/`test` (+ `gpu-check`, `*-check`) via `docker compose` v2.
- **`tests/`:** 17 pytest smoke/health tests (service health, embeddings, LLM, Qdrant, cuOpt).

**Verified results (reported from on-device run):**
- `docker compose up` → 3 containers healthy on `helix-gb10-intern`.
- **api:** GPU visible inside container, CUDA 13, nvcc present.
- **llm:** Nemotron served via vLLM; completion test passes; **~31.48 GiB** GPU allocated.
- **embeddings:** nomic-embed loaded on GPU, 768-dim verified; **~813 MiB** allocated.
- **vectordb:** Qdrant create/insert/query round-trip passes.
- **cuOpt:** **no arm64 `cuopt-cu13` wheel** → **fell back to OR-Tools (CPU)**; VRP solved,
  route `[0, 1, 3, 2, 0]`, distance `80`. (Proceed-without-blocking honored.)
- **Tests:** reported **17/17 passing** on the GB10.

**Review corrections made this session:**
- Fixed `docker-compose.yml` header comment (claimed "Four-service … cuopt-fallback"; actually
  3 services with cuOpt integrated in `api`).
- Created this journal; added a journal-maintenance rule to `.devin/rules/helix-sco.md` and a
  pointer in the Plan of Action's mandatory-reading list.

**Known issues / follow-ups (carry into later phases):**
- **Overclaim corrected:** the prior session's summary said it created `walkthrough.md`; that
  file does **not** exist in the repo. This journal is the system of record instead.
- **Unpinned `:latest`** on `vllm/vllm-openai` and `qdrant/qdrant` → not reproducible. Pin to
  verified tags/digests.
- **torch via `--extra-index-url .../cu131`** is unusual; it resolved to a CUDA aarch64 build
  that works, but pin a known-good wheel.
- **No API auth yet.** The "API-first *secure*" directive (authN/authZ, validation, secrets)
  is **not** met — deferred to the Phase 2 API layer. Acceptable for a Phase 0 baseline.
- **I did not re-run** the GPU/LLM suite in this review session (heavy: model downloads + long
  vLLM warmup); I verified the sources compile and audited logic. Re-run `make up && make test`
  to re-confirm before relying on the numbers above.

## 2026-06-30 — Iteration 2 docs updated for Ryan's decisions
**Git:** committed `fc22dae` (pushed).
- Folded Ryan's 2026-06-30 feedback into `docs/Iteration2_Plan_of_Action.md` and
  `docs/Iteration2_Point3_Scaffolding_Response_to_Ryan.md`:
  Manufacturing vertical; **Nemotron ~30B FP8 MoE** (single shared LLM); **nomic-embed-text-v1.5**;
  **Qdrant** (LanceDB fallback); **GPU-accelerated ingestion**; **API-first secure APIs**
  (web + CLI + future MCP share them); **Docker Compose v2**; **Dev/PoC** product shape;
  **proceed-without-blocking**; NVAIE not needed for dev (NFR available).
- Converted the Response doc's "open questions" into a confirmed-decisions table.

## 2026-06-29 / 30 — Iteration 2 scaffolding docs authored
**Git:** committed `efbf7e2` (pushed); branch `feat/iteration2-scaffolding-and-poa` created.
- `docs/Iteration2_Point3_Scaffolding_Response_to_Ryan.md` — tools/models scaffolding answer
  (models + why + fit), web-UI vs CLI, before/after scenario stats.
- `docs/Iteration2_Plan_of_Action.md` — phased build blueprint (Phase 0–6) for a fresh agent.
- Later edited to remove verbatim quoting of Ryan's messages and a self-contradicting
  hard-coded UI percentage; corrected an OR-Tools/HiGHS routing inaccuracy.

## (earlier) — Iteration 1 + environment baseline
- `docs/AI_Jumpstart_MVP_Iteration1_v1_paper-grounded.md` and `_v2_standalone.md` — use-case map,
  data elements, pipeline shape, honest reconciliation of the PPO/(s,S) evidence.
- `docs/environment.md` — live GB10 probe (arm64, CUDA 13.0, driver 580.159.03, 121 GiB unified,
  ~273 GB/s bandwidth).
- `docs/containerization.md` — GPU-in-container verified; pinned arm64 CUDA 13 base; NGC dev key
  configured; `ishan` added to `docker` group.
- `.devin/rules/helix-sco.md` — non-negotiable guardrails (bandwidth-bound; PPO must earn its
  place; ~94% figure framing; no hospital service-level claim; data on-device; flag prompt-injection).
